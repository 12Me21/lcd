A replacement for the digiline LCD.

- Text is now left-aligned (rather than weirdly aligned off-center)
- Improved text wrapping algorithm (Lines are no longer cut off if there aren't any spaces)
- Better font (and easier to customize)
- 6x11 characters (by default) (close to the original 5x12)
- Uses standard "\n" for linebreaks rather than " | "
